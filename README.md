# Nowster

A terminal app that's only (for now) purpose is to load the latest notes.

WIP: basically I am coding this for fun and get familiar with some libs like [rust-nostr](https://rust-nostr.org/)

todo:
- [x] fetch my followers events only
- [ ] r for refresh and go up
- [ ] improve the look
- [ ] init setup (when no key in store) relay select etc.
- [ ] b {id} open in browser (p {id} )
- [ ] p {id} -> fetch name
